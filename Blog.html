<p>I see a lot of information about healing all over. Possibly because I have an interest in this field. I think this topic is very relevant in a time where a lot of focus is on illnesses. I lost a friend to cancer and know of people suffering all over. I have not been sick often even as a child. As an adult I had some issues and once I started on this healing journey I learned some valuable lessons. From authors such as Louise Hay and Deb Shapiro comes a very unique take on disease. Both from different backgrounds tie thoughts and mind-set to disease. Louise Hay was a volunteer at a church dealing with alternate healing. Deb Shapiro is a medical doctor and observed patterns of illness in patients. I decided to test out this the idea. When I get sick I look at what could be causes and critically look at my situation at the time. I find that honesty is a quality that starts with yourself. Once I find a possible cause I take the action to improve. Chemical medicine as I call it is great to relieve symptoms and attack infections. So I find it works well if you want relief quickly. With changing my mind-set and being mentally healthy I find that illnesses I do get are less severe and shorter in duration. So I am staying balanced and healthy by doing energy work. I check in on how my current thoughts affect my health. I take action when I need to improve my health. I use every option available to me even herbal and chemical medicines. I also believe that no person stands alone and listen when advice comes my way from any and every source. I look forward to helping others add an extra weapon in their recovery and being healthy arsenal. </p>
