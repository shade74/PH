<h3>Hi I'm Riaan</h3>

<div class="About">
  <h3>About me</h3>
<p>I have been trained in Western Reiki and Karuna ReikiÂ®. For me healing and helping people is a calling and a passion. Reiki forms the main component of my offering to you. I do have other skills that I use and the set of skills grows as time goes by. For me the most important aspect of healing is the person who needs help. It is a thrilling journey and people always grow in every period of happiness or hardship. I am one component of that process and always willing to help. </p>

  <h3>What is Reiki</h3>
<p>
  Reiki is an energy healing system that uses hand positions and a healer to channel energy to you. I say that for a writer a pen is a vital component of writing. In Reiki the healer is the facilitator or pen. This energy helps you to get to a point closer to ideal or harmony. In this it assists in adding to your wellbeing. It is also a way to spoil yourself to some me time and a chance to press the reset button.

  <h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p>
   Reiki is done on a raised bed. You are welcome to dress comfortably for the session. There is a time to discuss your situation or check in on how you are. We set the intention for the healing and I do many steps lasting from 45 minutes to an hour. After the healing you will get time to get back to normal movement and coherence and get some water to drink.
